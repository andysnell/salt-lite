# Salt-Lite Common Library

> Feels like home, just without the salty tears of frustration

The Salt-Lite Framework is a "batteries-included" PHP framework, modeled on other
modern frameworks like Symfony and Laravel, derived from the original Salt project.
Ideally, it adapts the best core features of Salt without dragging along unnecessary
complexity, technical debt and design decisions we regret. The goal is to provide
users with a robust framework with minimum cognitive overhead from the original
Salt framework, avoiding the pitfalls of bringing in a full-fledged third-party
framework and trying to adapt that to our needs.

This package contains the common library for the Salt-Lite framework, which includes
the core functionality and shared components used by the framework. It is designed 
to work with either the Salt-Lite framework or the original Salt framework, providing a consistent
and reliable foundation for building applications.
